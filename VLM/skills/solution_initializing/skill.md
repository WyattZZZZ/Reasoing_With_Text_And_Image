description: Interprets the user's intent and establishes a strategic plan for solving the problem. Use at the very beginning of a task to set the direction.

```markdown
When initializing a solution, always include:

1. **Intent Interpretation & Multimodal Summary**: Restate the user's goal and provide a concise summary of all provided information, including multimodal data.
2. **Requirement Extraction**: List all constraints, given values, and target metrics.
3. **Strategic Planning**: Outline the necessary stages and tools to reach the solution using a TODO list format (e.g., `- [ ] Task`). Mark completed steps with `[x]`.
4. **Visualization Ideas (Optional)**: List ideas for images to generate using the drawing tool. Format: `- Image Name: Image Prompt`.
5. **Initial Hypothesis**: State if any immediate patterns or obvious first steps are visible.

Focus on clarity and scope definition. Set the stage for the reasoning and derivation phases.
